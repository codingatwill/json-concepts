# Concept Keys in Shadows

> shadow should have name of the concept for the key of its identifier.
> if there is a child literal or variable with the name of the concept, this
> means it will override that value.
> default key can be altered using indexer syntax `[]`;
> e.g. for `$database[type]`, key is `type`
> e.g. for `$database[database,type]`, same value will be both at `type` and at
> `database`
>
> concept name can be pluralized using pluralization syntax `()`;
> e.g. for `$period(s)*`, concept parent key becomes `periods`
> e.g. for `$child(ren)*`, concept parent key becomes `children`
> e.g. for `$city(-ies)*`, concept parent key becomes `cities`
> e.g. for `$analysis(--es)*`, concept parent key becomes `analyses`
> e.g. for `$mouse(----ice)*`, concept parent key becomes `mice`
> e.g. for `$mouse(^mice)*`, concept parent key becomes `mice`
